#### Prompt

 > Your supervisor has asked you to prepare a report on the
geography of aging within the County. In particular, she is very interested in producing
maps that precisely illustrate where communities with proportionally large
numbers of elderly people are located. Further, given your experience working with
Census data and HCAAA outreach efforts post-Hurricane Harvey, she also wants you to
identify the most economically vulnerable elderly communities, as this is information
that will help guide the targeted social programs that HCAAA intends to carry out. Your
maps and analysis will constitute a crucial part of your supervisorâ€™s presentation to the
HCAAA advisory board.
