#### Prompt

 > Your supervisor has asked you to prepare a report on the
geography of aging within the County. In particular, she is very interested in producing
maps that precisely illustrate where communities with proportionally large
numbers of elderly people are located. Further, given your experience working with
Census data and HCAAA outreach efforts post-Hurricane Harvey, she also wants you to
identify the most economically vulnerable elderly communities, as this is information
that will help guide the targeted social programs that HCAAA intends to carry out. Your
maps and analysis will constitute a crucial part of your supervisorâ€™s presentation to the
HCAAA advisory board.

#### Prompt

> THA is interested in embarking on a project that outlines areas of unmet health care need
within the state of Texas. **Specifically, they are interested in determining three
potential sites within the state where new, specialized hospitals could meet the
needs of Texas residents**. In particular, they are interested in new hospitals that have one
of the following specializations:
*  Mental health services
*  Chemical dependency inpatient services
*  Long-term acute care (patients with complex illnesses who need multi-week hospital
stays)
*  Critical access hospital (hospitals certified for under-served rural populations)

> THA is deferring to you to determine
the specific criteria to be used for identifying suitable sites for new hospitals for **one of the
four specializations**, to be selected by you. However, they have specified some basic
guidelines. First, they want potential sites to be in areas that are under-served by other
hospitals that specialize in those areas; as such, sites should be in areas where current
hospital travel is burdensome for residents, or where the existing hospitals appear unable
to meet the needs of their areas. Second, sites should be responsive to the characteristics of
their communities. Specifically, THA would like you to identify places that might have a
need for hospitals with these specializations, given the demographic characteristics of
those places.
